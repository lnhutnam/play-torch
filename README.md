# Play Pytorch

## Environment Setup

In general, you can use any tools to create Python programming environment then install Pytorch easily. However, in my opinion, I don't like install via `conda` with yaml files, it seems to be slow. I like use `pip` to install Pytorch and other dependencies with `requirements.txt` file.

## Why I create this repo?

It's just a trash source code that mainly test somthing with Pytorch.

## Try Tensorflow?

No. I think I will try it on someday. The higher priority is JAX.
